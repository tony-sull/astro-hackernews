# Astro Hackernews Example

Hackernews example powered by [`astr`](https://astro.build), based on the [solid-start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/hackernews) Hackernews example.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Astro projects use [adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to build and deploy SSR apps to different deployment hosts.

This demo is deployed to Netlify Edge using the `@astrojs/netlify`.
